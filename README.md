# Elise

Hello, this is my first pet-project 

Elise is a combination of a simple interface, convolutional and classic neural networks based on the scikit-learn, pandas, opencv and tensorflow.

Elise can predict heart disease with 97% accuracy and pneumonia with 92% accuracy. If you do not trust to this numbers you can check it yourself.
1) To check accuracy of heart_model you can run model_build.py
2) If you want to ckeck accuracy of x_ray_model you can have a look at this https://github.com/TessaTlu/x_ray_model. Model using for predict pneumonia were developed and saved in jupyter. 

Elise_health_inspector is still being developed. In the future, I'm going to change the interface and add a few other options.
So here is instruction how to use Indi:
1) Download archive of project
2) Before running you should install some packages, run cmd in folder with project and type this:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
3) Now you can launch project: python run.py
4) If you want to upload your chest x-ray make sure that your photo looks like test_image_for_pneumania_predict
