# Indi 

Hello, this is my first pet-project 

Indi is a combination of a simple interface, convolutional and classic neural networks based on the scikit-learn, pandas, opencv and tensorflow

Indi can predict heart disease with 97% accuracy and pneumonia with 92% accuracy. If you do not trust to this numbers you can check it yourself.
1) To check accuracy of heart_model you can run model_build.py
2) If you want to ckeck accuracy of x_ray_model you can have a look at this guy https://www.kaggle.com/madz2000/pneumonia-detection-using-cnn-92-6-accuracy. My model is not much different from his and saved in x_ray_model

Indi_health_inspector is still being developed. In the future, I'm going to change the interface and add a few other options.
So here is instruction how to use Indi:
1) Download archive of project
2) python run.py 
3) If you want to upload your chest x-ray make sure that your photo looks like test_image_for_pneumania_predict
